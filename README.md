Welcome to the SMS Spam Classifier project! This repository contains a machine learning model that can classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). By utilizing natural language processing techniques, this classifier can effectively identify and filter out unwanted spam messages from your inbox.

## Features

- Accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or non-spam.
- Utilizes machine learning and natural language processing techniques.
- Easy to use and integrate into your own projects.
- Provides reliable and efficient spam detection.

## Demo

## Dataset
The SMS Spam Classifier was trained on [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) by UCI Machine Learning consisting of 5500+ messages. The dataset contains a collection of both spam and non-spam messages, allowing the model to learn the characteristics of each category.

## Usage
Using the SMS Spam Classifier is easy with the deployed Heroku application. Simply visit the following link: [Demo](https://sms-spam-classifier-vrqs9u9rn57.streamlit.app/)

1. Enter an SMS message in the input field.
2. Click the "Classify" button.
3. The classifier will determine if the message is spam or non-spam (ham) and display the result.
